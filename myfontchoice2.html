    <h1>The importance of fonts</h1>
    <p>The first font used is called 'Open Sans'and is slightly larger than the second one 'Lora', there is also more space between the letter which I think helps make the font easier to read.
    Neither of the fonts are too formal or informal, I believe that either of them would be good for a casual purpose but could still be used for more academic notes.
    This background colour is Fushia and is not right for this document exercise at all, if the font was any other colour this text would not even be readable.
    This colour should never be used outside of a thirteen-year-old's bedroom. </p>
