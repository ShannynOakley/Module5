    <h1>The importance of fonts</h1>
    <p>The first font used is called 'Open Sans'and is slightly larger than the second one 'Lora', there is also more space between the letter which I think helps make the font easier to read.
    Neither of the fonts are too formal or informal, I believe that either of them would be good for a casual purpose but could still be used for more academic notes. </p>
