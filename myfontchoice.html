    <h1>The importance of fonts</h1>
    <p>The first font used is called 'Open Sans'and is slightly larger than the second one 'Lora', there is also more space between the letter which I think helps make the font easier to read.
    Neither of the fonts are too formal or informal, I believe that either of them would be good for a casual purpose but could still be used for more academic notes.
    The background colour suits the rest of the page as it is not too dark or too distracting that the font itself gets lost. According to the 'Psychology of Color' blue is calming.</p>
